Version 1.0.1
--------------
 * [12797] Fixing a bug where when the sfGuardDoctrinePlugin was renamed to sfDoctrineGuardPlugin that the overriding of the sfGuardUser module did not work correctly. Making my own module for editing a guard user via ajax.
 * [9428] Fix to ensure sfContext actually has an instance by calling sfContext::hasInstance() prior to sfContext::getInstance().

   * This fix is compatible with both symfony 1.0 and symfony 1.1.
 * [9426] Corrected usage of sfDoctrineUsersPlugin (should be sfDoctrineUserPlugin).
